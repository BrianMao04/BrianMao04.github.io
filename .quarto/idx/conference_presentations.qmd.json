The complexity of the LABS problem grows rapidly with optimal solutions only known for N≤66. In this work, a novel probabilistic quantum-inspired approach for this problem was formulated and solved.

This work represents the first demonstration of a GPU accelerated solution to the LABS problem, creating a 1500% improvement in speed over a CPU only version. Low-level system design optimizations such as dynamic mixed precision allowed full device utilization for this compute-bound problem. This approach yielded time-to-solution scaling of 1.229\\^N and number of calls scaling of 1.187\\^N, whereas the best-known classical heuristic, memetic tabu search yielded a number of calls scaling of 1.35\\^N.

A novel clustering algorithm is formulated and solved using quantum-inspired computing through the TitanQ platform to incorporate these constraint types, while directly solving the clustering problem via distance minimization. One example of a constraint is the generation of balanced clusters, where the number of nodes within each cluster is approximately equal. Quantum and quantum-inspired techniques, including mappings to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, are leveraged to solve large-scale problems.
