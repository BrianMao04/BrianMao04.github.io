Similar challenges are posed in autonomous racing, where a software stack, instead of a human driver, interacts within a multi-agent environment. For an Autonomous Racing Vehicle (ARV), operating at the edge of handling limits and acting safely in these dynamic environments is still an unsolved problem. A baseline controls stack for an ARV capable of operating safely up to 140mph. The stack is compared to similar controls and modelling schemes and limitations in the current approach are discussed to present ideas for tackling these shortcomings.\n\n<img src=\"images/Racecar.png\" alt=\"Racecar\" width=\"280\"/> <img src=\"images/Controller.png\" alt=\"Controller\" width=\"390\"/>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n## [**Road Surface Estimation Using Machine Learning**](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/8a059e7c-b0cc-4578-a6f9-69a674849929)\n\nVehicle motion control systems are present on commercial vehicles to improve safety and driving comfort.
