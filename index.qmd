Brian possesses a Master's in Applied Mathematics and Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Waterloo.

In his most recent position, he was the Head of Algorithms at [InfinityQ Technology Inc](https://www.infinityq.tech/), which was a startup focused on developing quantum-inspired solutions to solve mathematical optimization problems. In this role, he led a team of mathematicians and engineers to consult with clients and develop customized solutions throughout various application areas including transportation, manufacturing supply chain, computational chemistry, energy grid management, and finance. In addition, the Algorithms Team actively conducted research to improve the performance of an internal proprietary optimization solver. Several substantial discoveries and results have also been presented at various academic conferences.

Prior to InfinityQ, he was the Path Planning and Controls Lead at [MIT Driverless](https://driverless.mit.edu/), where he led multiple sub-teams to program a racecar to drive fully autonomously at over 240 km/h. He also worked at [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com/) under the Metal Tooling team where he developed an internal iOS app and created simulations of various manufacturing processes. Overall, Brian has acquired a wide range of experiences across various disciplines of engineering, mathematics, and computer science.
