A bag valve mask is a device used by paramedics to provide ventilation for patients who are not breathing adequately, or at all. It has been shown there are inconsistent pumping rates between different trained medical professionals. This leads to a consistent failure to meet specific volume requirements. The Automatic Inhalation Resuscitator (AIR) is a device that is compact, inexpensive, and capable of delivering consistent breaths to a patient through bag valve mask compressions. The objective is to reduce the amount of medical attention and expertise required to operate a bag valve mask.

## Applications

1.  This device could act as a low cost alternative to a traditional ventilator to alleviate ventilator shortages caused during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The final design only requires a 3D printer and laser cutter for quick and simple fabrication.

2.  First responders work tirelessly to ventilate a patient and keep them breathing until they return to a hospital. These patients often incur other serious injuries that require attention. AIR could be used to reallocate a paramedic's set of hands to treat these injuries for improved patient care.

3.  Family members are often trained to perform manual ventilation using bag valve mask compressions in underdeveloped countries. As full size modern ventilators are not easily accessible in these locations, one may be forced to perform this resuscitation for several hours. Inconsistencies in breath parameters become even more significant when operated by an inexperienced person for a prolonged period.
