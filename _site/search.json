    "text": "Robust Modeling and Controls for Racing on the Edge\nRace cars are routinely driven to the edge of their handling limits in dynamic scenarios well above 200mph. Similar challenges are posed in autonomous racing, where a software stack, instead of a human driver, interacts within a multi-agent environment. For an Autonomous Racing Vehicle (ARV), operating at the edge of handling limits and acting safely in these dynamic environments is still an unsolved problem. A baseline controls stack for an ARV capable of operating safely up to 140mph. The stack is compared to similar controls and modelling schemes and limitations in the current approach are discussed to present ideas for tackling these shortcomings."

    "text": "Road Surface Estimation Using Machine Learning\nVehicle motion control systems are present on commercial vehicles to improve safety and driving comfort. Many of these control systems could be further improved given accurate online information about the road condition to accommodate for driving under poor weather conditions such as icy roads or heavy rain. However, sensors for direct friction measurement are not present on commercial vehicles due to production costs. Hence, it is beneficial to incorporate an online estimation scheme for road surface classification.\nTwo fundamentally different machine learning-based methods for road surface classification. The first is an artificial neural network that provides a global function approximation of the underlying dynamics. In particular, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units are used to capture temporal relationships within the training data and to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The second is an instance-based learning method referred to as Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression, where local function approximations are generated around the input data."

The final design only requires a 3D printer and laser cutter for quick and simple fabrication.\nFirst responders work tirelessly to ventilate a patient and keep them breathing until they return to a hospital. These patients often incur other serious injuries that require attention. AIR could be used to reallocate a paramedic’s set of hands to treat these injuries for improved patient care.\nFamily members are often trained to perform manual ventilation using bag valve mask compressions in underdeveloped countries. As full size modern ventilators are not easily accessible in these locations, one may be forced to perform this resuscitation for several hours. Inconsistencies in breath parameters become even more significant when operated by an inexperienced person for a prolonged period."

These methods range from simulated annealing to more advanced variants such as parallel tempering and simulated quantum annealing.

However, most traditional clustering algorithms do not incorporate constraints that may arise in real world problems, while also using heuristics which can negatively impact cluster quality. A novel clustering algorithm is formulated and solved using quantum-inspired computing through the TitanQ platform to incorporate these constraint types, while directly solving the clustering problem via distance minimization. One example of a constraint is the generation of balanced clusters, where the number of nodes within each cluster is approximately equal. Quantum and quantum-inspired techniques, including mappings to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations, are leveraged to solve large-scale problems. This provides the ability to potentially utilize next generation hardware to increase problem scale, solution quality, and solution speed. Native constraints are also included to enforce valid clustering solutions among the binary variables used to represent cluster assignments. This allows for increased algorithmic performance, with the addition of a novel compression scheme to induce memory improvement. Resulting clusters from the algorithm were also benchmarked against Lloyd’s algorithm on a dataset containing approximately 3000 data points."
